# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning web app to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, built with **Random Forest Classifier** and optimized using **GridSearchCV**. The app is deployed using **Streamlit** and developed in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on features like age, gender, class, and more. The model is trained using a Random Forest classifier, and hyperparameters are fine-tuned using Grid Search with Cross-Validation.
